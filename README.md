Welcome to DeLetter!

With 10 years of experience in credit control and a passion for web development, I saw an opportunity to combine my professional experience and self-taught programming skills to create a useful tool for others.

DeLetter is an app designed to help individuals and businesses draft demand letters in just a few easy steps. To get started, the user will only need to input the necessary information, including the customer's billing address and outstanding invoices. The app will then generate a demand letter based on the provided information. Once you have finalised the letter, you can preview it to ensure that all the information is correct and that the letter is formatted correctly. 

The app also keeps track of all the user-generated customers and invoices with the option to delete data.

The DeLetter app was built using the following technologies:

Language: TypeScript
UI Library: React.js
Backend: Node.js
Database: Firebase Real-time Database
Design: Sass: I used Sass to write clean and maintainable styles
Testing: Jest and React Testing Library 

My background in credit control has given me a deep understanding of the importance of effective debt collection, and I hope that DeLetter will be a valuable resource for others in similar roles.

If you have any questions or feedback regarding the DeLetter app, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for checking out DeLetter.
