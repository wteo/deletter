# DeLetter

Welcome to DeLetter!

With 10 years of experience in credit control and a passion for web development, I saw an opportunity to combine my professional experience and self-taught programming skills to create a useful tool for others.

This is an updated version from my previous app <a href="https://github.com/wteo/demandLetter">Demand Letter</a>, which was one of my first personal projects when I started learning web development. As I gain more confidence in my coding skills and learn more JavaScript frameworks and/or libraries, I decided to create a new and improved version of the old app, which leads to DeLetter. 


<h2>About</h2>

DeLetter is an app designed to help individuals and businesses draft demand letters in just a few easy steps. To get started, the user will only need to input the necessary information, including the customer's billing address and outstanding invoices. The app will then generate a demand letter based on the provided information. Once you have finalised the letter, you can preview it to ensure that all the information is correct and that the letter is formatted correctly. 

To use the app, you'll need first to register.


<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

The DeLetter app was built using the following technologies:
<ul>
<li>Language: TypeScript</li>
<li>UI Library: React.js</li>
<li>Backend: Node.js</li>
<li>Database: Firebase Real-time Database</li>
<li>Design: Sass</li>
<li>Testing: Jest and React Testing Library</li>
</ul>


<h2>Final words</h2>

My background in credit control has given me a deep understanding of the importance of effective debt collection, and I hope that DeLetter will be a valuable resource for others in similar roles.

If you have any questions or feedback regarding the DeLetter app, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for checking out DeLetter.
